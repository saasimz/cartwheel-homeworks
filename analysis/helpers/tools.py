"""The agent-facing helper functions of the error-analysis skill.

These are the functions the coding agent calls across the error-analysis
loop. They are *instructor-provided and fully implemented*: students call
them, they are not homework holes. Each wraps file-backed state under
``analysis/state/`` (Artifact J layout). DocETL executes judge batches, while
the statistical helpers operate directly on persisted labels and predictions.

Loop-stage map (Outline helper table):

  - :func:`select_traces`     stages 1, 4  (open-coding / coverage batches)
  - :func:`next_to_label`     stages 6, 9  (collect additional human judgments)
  - :func:`split_labels`      stage 8       (train/dev/test)
  - :func:`register_judge`    stages 7, 9   (each prompt edit is a version)
  - :func:`run_judge`         stages 8-10   (cached predictions)
  - :func:`judge_alignment`   stages 8, 9   (TPR/TNR/agreement on a split)
  - :func:`iteration_log`     stage 9       (the hill-climbing table)
  - :func:`freeze_judge`      stage 9       (locks the version, unlocks test)

The prevalence and reporting helpers (:func:`corrected_prevalence`,
:func:`failure_report`) live in ``reporting.py`` and re-export from the
package root.

State access here is deliberately explicit and dependency-light so every
run is inspectable. The prevalence calculation lives in ``reporting.py``;
the selection signals (clustering, semantic neighbors,
uncertainty) live in ``selection.py``.

def judge_alignment(judge_id: str, split: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Score a judge against the human labels on a split.

    Computes TPR, TNR, overall agreement, the confusion counts, and the
    disagreement trace ids with Pass as the positive class and Fail as the
    negative class. Stored mode labels remain failure indicators, so the
    helper converts them before computing the statistics. Running on ``dev`` auto-appends a row to the
    iteration log (version, dev TPR/TNR). Running on ``test`` raises unless
    the judge is frozen: the test split is unavailable until you freeze
    (the guard). ``run_judge`` must have produced predictions for the split
    first.

    Args:
        judge_id: the judge to score.
